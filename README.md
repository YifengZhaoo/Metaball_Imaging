# MI

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Metaball-Imaging (MI) algorithm. 

MI is an imaging algorithm which can reconstruct the realisic particle morpholgoies with the Metaball function in high fidelity, which can be loaded into Metaball-Imaging Discrete Element method [MI-DELBM](https://github.com/YifengZhaoo/MI_DELBM) for simulations of fluid-particle systems. Notably, the MI algorithm exists in two distinct versions: a heuristic-based approach and a geometric-based approach, each discussed in separate papers, as detailed below.

This repository contains the associated manuscript, code, data, and supplementary materials. We hope this work will be helpful to the research community and encourage further collaboration and exploration in the field.  If you find my work of interest, please feel free to cite, implement, or reuse it as needed. Your engagement and collaboration are highly encouraged. 

## Paper's DOI Link
The heurictic-based version is available through this [doi link](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0135834). And the geometric-based version can be found through this [doi link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compgeo.2023.105564). 

## Code and Data
The Code and Data will be released soon.
